> Reverb doesn’t just add space — it tells your mix where it lives.

## 🎯 Reverb Types

| Type         | Use Case                        |
|--------------|----------------------------------|
| Plate        | Vocals, snares, synths          |
| Room         | Guitars, dry vocals             |
| Hall         | Pads, orchestral, strings       |
| Chamber      | Retro lush tails, wide synths   |
| Spring       | Guitars, FX, experimental       |

## 🛠️ Setup Tips

### Use a **Send/Return Reverb Bus**
- Keeps mix clean
- Allows better control + EQ
- Multiple tracks can share reverb tail = cohesion

### Pre-Delay
- 20–50 ms lets dry signal hit before verb
- Keeps things “clear but deep”

## 🎛️ Shaping Tools

| Tool         | Use It For                             |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------|
| EQ           | Cut lows <200 Hz, tame mids             |
| Modulation   | Adds vintage wobble                     |
| Ducking      | Sidechain reverb to dry signal (vocal clarity) |
| Reverb Decay Automation | Longer in chorus, shorter in verse |

## 🧠 Pro Tips

- **High-pass the reverb return** to avoid mud
- **Don’t stack reverbs** unless you EQ each tail
- Try **early reflections only** for stereo thickening without “verbiness”
