# 🧠 Personal Learning Profile

This file allows Junior to adapt to how you learn best.

---

## Learning Style Observations

- Prefers narrative guidance over strict tutorials
- Learns best through doing (applied technique beats pure theory)
- Interested in emotional and spatial sound design
- Enjoys “weird but practical” solutions
- Needs light structure, not heavy order

---

## Teaching Strategies (to use going forward)

- 🧠 **Spaced Repetition:** Revisit a key concept from the past 3–5 days at the start of a lesson
- ✋ **Active Recall:** Ask a question before explaining a technique (e.g. “What would sidechaining the verb tail do?”)
- 🔁 **Interleaving:** Mix topics (e.g. LFO routing + emotional tension curves)
- 🎲 **Gamification:** Give challenges with optional modifiers or constraints
- 🎯 **Scaffolded Tasks:** Break down lessons into a conceptual bit + a “Try it in Ableton” task
- 🧠 **Meta Reflection:** Ask user after each module: “What part clicked?” or “What felt confusing?” and log the feedback here
