# Modulation with Intention

## Objective:
Go beyond "just moving a knob." Learn how modulation adds motion, tension, and musicality.

## Core Techniques:

### 1. LFOs on FX (With Purpose)
- **Use Case:** Automate flanger speed or chorus depth to match energy.
- **Example:** Use an LFO to modulate reverb dry/wet during the chorus for a swelling room.
- **Try This:**  
  1. Add a Chorus-Ensemble to your pad.  
  2. Map an LFO to the Depth knob.  
  3. Set it to a synced sine wave (1 bar rate).  
  4. Listen as the pad breathes in and out.

### 2. Envelope Followers for Synth FX
- Add an Envelope Follower to a synthâ€™s filter or distortion.
- This creates movement *only when the synth is active*.
- **Try This:**  
  - Load an aggressive bass patch.  
  - Put an Envelope Follower on it.  
  - Map it to Saturator Drive.  
  - Now the harder the synth hits, the more distortion it gets.

### 3. Automation Arcs & Emotional Tension
- Instead of flat automation lines, use **ramps and curves** that mirror emotional intent.
- **Build tension:** Gradually increase delay feedback over 4 bars.
- **Release tension:** Pull low-pass filter cutoff *way up* on the drop.
