## ðŸŽ¯ Core Difference

| Tool            | Best For                                |
|------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Compression     | Reacting dynamically in real time        |
| Volume Automation | Precise, manual level shaping           |

## ðŸ’¡ When to Automate Instead of Compress

- **Vocals**: Ride syllables into compressor for more natural tone
- **Bass**: Bring up low notes without crushing peaks
- **FX/Delays**: Pull down reverb tail in breakdown
- **Pads**: Add swells and tension builds

---

## ðŸ§  Hybrid Strategy

### 1. Automate FIRST
- Adjust clips to level performance (clip gain, volume envelope)

### 2. Compress SECOND
- Now your compressor works less = more transparency

## ðŸ”§ Ableton Tips

- Use **Utility gain** for transparent clip-level rides
- Draw automation curves across sections (use S-shape, ramps)

ðŸ§  *Compression smooths â€” but automation sculpts.*
