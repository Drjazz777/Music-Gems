## 🧪 Why Use Buses?

- Keeps mix **glued together**
- **Saves CPU**
- Allows **fine automation control**
- Balances reverb/delay on one fader

## ✅ Ableton FX Bus Setup

1. Create **Return Track**
2. Drop FX (Reverb, Delay, etc.)
3. Set **Dry/Wet = 100%**
4. Use **Send Amounts** on any track

---

## 💡 Pro Uses

- Send vocal + synths to same reverb = cohesive space
- Delay on return allows tempo-sync + filter tricks
- Use **EQ before and after FX** (e.g., LPF before reverb)

💡 *When tracks share a room, they share a vibe. FX buses create that room.*
