## 📐 Panning Basics

| Instrument       | Common Placement   |
|------------------|---------------------|
| Kick & Bass      | Dead center (mono)  |
| Lead Vocal       | Center              |
| Snare            | Center or slight L/R|
| Pads/Chords      | Wide (20–50% L/R)   |
| Guitars          | Hard or semi-wide   |
| BGVs / Doubles    | Opposite sides (30–60%) |
| Perc FX / Hats   | Asymmetrical spread |

## 🧠 Advanced Panning Techniques

### 1. **Paired Layer Panning**
- Two synths or guitars? Pan one left (e.g. 25%), one right (25%)
- Match their EQ ranges to avoid muddy L/R imbalance

### 2. **LCR Mixing (Left-Center-Right)**
- Pan hard L/R or dead center
- Forces space between parts, creating room for FX tails or mono elements

### 3. **Symmetry Check**
- Use a goniometer or stereo meter
- Balanced mixes should show mirrored energy L/R

## 🧪 Width Safety Tips

- Never spread sub-bass. Keep below 120 Hz mono
- Use **mid/side EQ** to widen **only the highs**
- Avoid excessive stereo FX (chorus/flanger) on low elements

🧠 *Great mixes aren’t just EQ’d right — they’re placed right.*
