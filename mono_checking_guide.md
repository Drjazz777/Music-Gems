# 🎧 Mono Compatibility & Phase Safety

> Great stereo is fun. **Surviving mono playback** is essential.

---

## 🎯 Why It Matters

- Detuned synths can cancel each other out
- Bass collapse ruins club/phone playback
- Phase issues cause “ghost notes” and dropouts

---

## 🧪 Common Mono Hazards

| Element             | Risk                                          |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Wide pads           | Chorus/flanger can cancel midrange            |
| Reese bass          | Detuned saws cancel in mono                   |
| Drum overheads      | Phasey hats/cymbals lose clarity              |
| Wide reverb         | Hall verbs get hollow, lose impact            |

## 🛠️ How to Check

### 1. Use a Mono Utility
- In Ableton: **Utility → Width = 0%**
- Or enable mono monitoring on interface

### 2. Visualize Phase
- Load a goniometer (e.g. Voxengo SPAN or Youlean)
- A narrow vertical line = safe
- A wide horizontal smear = phasey

### 3. A/B Solo in Mono
- Play bass, synth, drums in mono
- Listen for “disappearing” notes or power loss

---

## 🩹 Fixes

### Stereo Width Management
- Keep subs **mono** below 100 Hz
- Use **mono-compatible chorus** (e.g., TAL-Chorus-LX)
- Avoid hard L/R panning of detuned synths

### Mid/Side EQ
- Use M/S EQ to **carve stereo tone only**
- Boost sparkle in side, leave mid clean

### Parallel Routing
- Dry mono + Wet stereo version = best of both
- Blend to taste and mono-check again

---

## ✅ Final Mix Routine

- Mono check your mix **before mastering**
- Do a final listen on **Bluetooth speaker or phone**
- Fix stereo phase *before* chasing loudness

💡 *If your mix only works in stereo — it doesn’t work everywhere.*
