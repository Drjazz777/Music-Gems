# 🥁 Drum Mixing Workflows

> Treating kicks, snares, hats, percussion, and loops for impact, clarity, and balance across genres.

---

## ✅ Kick Drum

- **EQ**:
  - HPF @ 30 Hz
  - Boost 60–100 Hz (thump)
  - Cut 250–400 Hz (mud)
- **Compression**: Medium-fast attack, fast release
- **Saturation**: Add punch and thickness

---

## ✅ Snare

- **EQ**:
  - Boost 200 Hz (body)
  - Boost 2–5 kHz (crack)
  - Cut below 100 Hz if layered with kick
- **Layering**:
  - Add clap/snap
  - Optional reverb tail layer
- **FX**:
  - Plate reverb (short), transient designer

---

## ✅ Hi-Hats

- **EQ**:
  - Cut low-mid gunk (200–500 Hz)
  - Boost 8–12 kHz (air)
- **Stereo**:
  - Pan left/right
  - Use delays for space
- **Saturation**: Optional for sparkle

---

## ✅ Percussion

- Use contrast: organic vs synthetic
- Pan hard for groove
- Use reverb or delay sparingly
- Automate FX for variation

---

## ✅ Loops

- Slice & rearrange for dynamics
- Use EQ to carve mids so they don’t clash
- Compress lightly
- Use as texture, not foreground unless intentional

---

## ✅ Drum Bus FX

- Glue Compressor:
  - 2:1 ratio, auto release
  - 1–3 dB gain reduction
- Tape or tube saturation
- Optional: reverb bus for shared space

💡 *Always A/B against reference tracks, especially for transients!*
