# Weird FX Chains That Work (Surprisingly Well)

Not everything needs to sound “pro.” Sometimes weird = unforgettable.

---

## 1. **Reverse Reverb Vocal Throws**
- Copy vocal phrase → reverse → reverb it → reverse again.
- Result: Reverb that *leads into* the vocal instead of trailing behind.

---

## 2. **Bitcrushed Delay**
- Place a bitcrusher *after* a stereo delay.
- Adds lo-fi, gritty echoes perfect for intros/outros or breakdowns.

---

## 3. **Resampled Tape Wash**
- Record a sound through heavy tape-style plugins.
- Reverse it.
- Add pitch LFO wobble + reverb.
- Layer under pads for “haunted VHS” texture.

---

## 4. **Low-Passed Chorus Bass**
- Bass → chorus → low-pass EQ below 500 Hz.
- Creates a stereo *ghost layer* that adds width to mono bass without losing punch.

---

## 5. **Vocal "Ghost Doubles"**
- Duplicate vocal take.
- Add OTT multiband compression + flanger + EQ to *only* keep mids.
- Lower volume — this becomes a whispery, metallic "ghost" layer behind the lead.

Break the signal path. The magic lives there.
