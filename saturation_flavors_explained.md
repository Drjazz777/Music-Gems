# Saturation Flavors Explained

## What is Saturation?
Saturation simulates analog hardware overload. It adds harmonics, compression, and warmth. Different types produce different vibes.

---

## 1. **Tube Saturation**
- Adds **even harmonics** (musical, warm, smooth).
- Softens transients slightly.
- Use on: **Vocals**, **guitars**, **bass** for warmth without losing clarity.

---

## 2. **Tape Saturation**
- Adds both **even & odd harmonics**.
- Compresses subtly, softens transients, and introduces slight low & high-frequency rolloff.
- May add **wow/flutter** and **noise**.
- Use on: **Mix bus**, **drums**, **instrument groups** for glue and vibe.

---

## 3. **Transistor (Console) Saturation**
- Adds subtle **odd harmonics** and midrange “forwardness.”
- Often very transparent unless pushed.
- Use on: **Drum bus**, **synths**, **guitars** to bring things forward.

---

## 4. **Digital Clipping**
- Harsh, obvious saturation that *destroys* transients.
- Use carefully (or aggressively for lofi).
- Use on: **808s**, **Reese basses**, **glitch FX**.

---

## Pro Tip:
Stack light saturation on *multiple buses* instead of overcooking one. It adds cumulative warmth without destroying dynamics.
