# Parallel Reverb Sculpting

## Problem:
Reverb makes things lush... but also muddy and undefined. The fix? Process your reverb like a track.

## Step-by-Step Parallel Reverb FX Bus

1. **Create a Return Track** in your DAW.
2. **Drop in a Reverb Plugin** (plate or hall).
   - Set **100% wet**.
   - Pre-delay ~30ms to let the dry vocal breathe.
   - Long decay = cinematic. Short decay = intimacy.

3. **Before the Reverb:**
   - **EQ** the signal (cut lows below 200Hz, highs above 8-10kHz).
   - **Saturate** slightly — adds grit and helps it cut through.
   - Optional: Add **compression** to keep tail consistent.

4. **After the Reverb:**
   - **EQ again**. Scoop 300-500Hz to remove mud.
   - Add a **gate** (if needed) to shorten tail in fast tracks.
   - Optional: Use **chorus** or **flanger** for movement.

## Tips:
- Send just the **tops of vocals** or **snare tails**.
- Use **automation** to send more reverb in breakdowns, less in verses.
- Try **multiple reverb buses** for different characters (small room + hall).

Treat reverb like its own voice — carve it, sculpt it, bend it.
