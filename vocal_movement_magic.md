# Vocal Movement Magic

## The Problem:
A vocal feels present in one section, but buried in another. It's not always about EQ or compression. It’s about *motion*.

## Secret Weapons
1. **Fader Automation:**
   - Ride the vocal up in busy sections, down in intimate ones.
   - Boost 1-2dB for chorus, drop in verses to create contrast.

2. **Filter Automation:**
   - Gently sweep a high-pass or high-shelf filter into the chorus to add brightness.
   - Use a low-pass filter to “hide” ad-libs or BVs during verses.

3. **Reverb Movement:**
   - Automate reverb send up at the end of phrases or lines.
   - Pull it down during dense sections to keep the lead dry and focused.

4. **Saturation Ramps:**
   - Add harmonic excitement via subtle distortion (like Softube Saturation Knob).
   - Automate drive to increase intensity during key phrases.

5. **Stereo Tricks:**
   - Slowly pan doubling vocals outward into a chorus for width.
   - Or pull them back in during a breakdown to tighten focus.

Think of the vocal like an actor on stage. Lights, distance, volume, and environment all matter.
