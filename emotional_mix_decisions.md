# Emotional Mix Decisions

Great mixes don’t just balance sounds — they express *feelings*.

---

## 🎭 Choose a Focus for Each Section
- What’s the **emotional driver** of the verse? A lonely vocal? A dry piano?
- What should **explode** in the chorus? Wide synths? Backing vocals?
- Decide → then sculpt everything else around that.

---

## 🥀 Sad = Soft Contrast
- Let vocals sit **upfront** with minimal FX.
- Use dark reverbs (plate, room), low decay, subtle.
- Push harmonic content into **midrange** (150 Hz – 3 kHz), roll off excessive highs.

---

## 💥 Aggression = Transients & Tightness
- Boost transients on drums with shapers.
- Use less reverb, more dry signal.
- Cut low-mids (250–500 Hz) to remove “woof.”
- Clip the master slightly for rawness.

---

## 🧊 Distance = Muffled Highs + Long Pre-Delay
- Combine **LPF + large reverb** to move something “away.”
- Use pre-delay to simulate space between source & environment.
- Pan wide + automate reverb up over time = “fade away” feel.

---

## 🌞 Intimacy = Dry Centered Mix
- Reverb = minimal or mono.
- Bass/vox/snare all center.
- Slight pitch drift or room noise can help it feel “real.”

Mixing is not just technical — it's emotional storytelling.
