## 🛠️ Suggested Bus Processing Chains

### 1. **Drum Bus**
- **Glue Compressor** (2–3 dB GR)
- **Saturation** (Tape or Softube)
- Optional: transient shaper

### 2. **Instrument Bus**
- **EQ**: high-pass 30 Hz, slight dip 300 Hz
- **Stereo Enhancer** or M/S EQ
- **Light compression** for motion

### 3. **Vocal Bus**
- **De-esser** + **EQ dip @ boxy zone**
- **Glue Comp** (slow attack, fast release)
- **Reverb Send** + **slight saturation**

## 🔁 Bonus: Parallel Buses

- Send drums to a parallel bus with heavy compression
- Blend in for NY-style punch
- Same trick works for vocals + synths
