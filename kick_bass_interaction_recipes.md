# Kick & Bass Interaction Recipes

Your kick and bass are like dancers — they can groove together, take turns, or fight. Choose one.

---

## 🔁 Option 1: **Alternate Groove (Dance Together)**
- **EQ the Kick** to live at ~60 Hz.
- **EQ the Bass** to peak around 90-100 Hz.
- Add gentle **sidechain compression** on the bass keyed from the kick (2-3dB duck).
- Use if: You want **bounce** (house, funk, breakbeat).

---

## 🔄 Option 2: **Layered Weight (Hit Together)**
- Choose one frequency as the **shared center** (e.g., 60-70 Hz).
- **High-pass the kick** slightly to avoid sub rumble.
- Let the bass dominate subs, let the kick own the upper lows (80-120 Hz).
- Add a **transient shaper** to boost the attack of the kick if the bass has a slow envelope.

---

## 🔥 Option 3: **Sidechain Domination (Kick Wins)**
- Kick is short and punchy.
- Bass is thick and long.
- **Aggressively sidechain the bass** to make the kick slam through (5-10dB duck).
- Optional: Use LFO Tool or ShaperBox for rhythmic ducking.
- Use for: **Trap, EDM, Pop**, where the **kick must punch hard**.

## Pro Tips:
- Use **spectrum analyzers** to visually find clashing frequencies.
- Consider **stereo spread**: keep both elements mono below ~120 Hz.
