# ADVANCED_PANNING_AND_WIDTH.md

Stereo width and spatial separation are key to a pro-sounding mix. This guide covers psychoacoustic tricks, advanced mid/side techniques, and mono-safe widening.

## ðŸ§  Core Panning Concepts

- **LCR Mixing** (Left-Center-Right) creates natural width by hard-panning key elements and anchoring others dead center.
- **Rule of Thirds:** Pan similar instruments slightly offset (e.g., guitar 1 @ 30L, guitar 2 @ 40R) to reduce clutter.

## ðŸ§° Stereo Width Tools

### Utility Plugin (Ableton/Logic/Pro Tools)

- Set **Width to 0%** = mono
- Set to **>100%** = pseudo widening
- Use to **collapse** low end below 120 Hz

### Haas Effect (Micro-Delay Widening)

- Duplicate signal
- Delay one side by 10â€“30 ms
- **Warning:** May cause phase cancellation in mono
- Always A/B in mono after using!

### Mid/Side EQ

- EQ **mid channel** for clarity (e.g., cut mids from pads)
- Boost **side highs** to widen without harshness

## âœ… Safe Width Guidelines

- Keep **kick, bass, snare, lead vocal** in mono (center)
- Use width **above 300 Hz**, and keep sub-bass mono
- Always mono-check after adding wideners

## ðŸŽ› Tricks

- **Reverb Width:** Put reverb return in stereo and EQ side info separately
- **Instrument Layering:** Pan dry signal center, FX layer wide (e.g., 20â€“30% L/R)
- **Stereo Delay/Chorus:** Use modulation rate offset L/R for width without phase issues
