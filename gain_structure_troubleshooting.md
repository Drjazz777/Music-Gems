# Gain Structure Troubleshooting Guide

Poor gain staging leads to distorted plugins, a muddy mix, or inconsistent dynamics — even with great sound design.

## 🔍 Signs of Gain Structure Issues

- Plugins acting unpredictably (e.g., compressors slamming harder than expected)
- Saturators distorting too early or not at all
- Your mix is super quiet but clips when mastered
- Loudness meter reads fine, but the mix sounds “congested”

## ✅ Ideal Gain Targets

| Stage                 | Peak Target      | RMS Target     |
|----------------------|------------------|----------------|
| Individual Tracks     | -12 dB to -6 dB  | Varies         |
| Busses/Subgroups      | -10 dB to -4 dB  | -18 to -12 dBFS|
| Master Bus (pre FX)   | -6 dBFS or lower | -16 to -14 LUFS|

**Pro Tip:** Insert a VU Meter on key tracks to calibrate levels visually.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Checklist

### 1. **Check Clip Gains & Input Levels**
- In Ableton: right-click the clip and enable "Gain" view. Look for hot signals.
- Normalize only if necessary — don’t squash dynamics.

### 2. **Balance Pre- and Post-FX Levels**
- A plugin may output louder than it inputs.
- Use output trims and gain match before/after using any saturation, compression, or limiting.

### 3. **Use Utility or Gain Plugins to Set Pre-FX Headroom**
- Insert early in the chain to stabilize input levels.
- Keep consistent levels for parallel chains, especially on vocals and drums.

### 4. **Check for Overloaded Busses**
- Group busses often build up unintended gain.
- Use a peak meter (or utility) after the group’s last plugin.

### 5. **Always Gain-Match Saturation/Distortion**
- Louder isn’t better — it’s just louder.
- Bypass A/B with matched volume to judge tone, not loudness.

## 🧠 Golden Rule
> "Loud happens at the end. Headroom happens first."
