## 🧠 Why Automate?

Automation lets you:
- Control FX over time
- Build tension and release
- Add variation without changing the core arrangement

## 🎨 Common Parameters to Automate

| Plugin Type        | Useful Parameters              |
|--------------------|--------------------------------|
| Filter             | Cutoff, resonance              |
| Delay              | Feedback, dry/wet              |
| Reverb             | Size, decay, mix               |
| EQ                 | Low/high cut sweeps            |
| Volume             | Swells, fades, impact points   |
| Pan                | LFO pan or width tricks        |

## 🔁 Time-Based Tricks

- **Filter sweep before chorus** (LPF opens to reveal energy)
- **Delay tail throw on last vocal word**
- **Reverb rise before drop** (builds atmosphere)
- **Volume “duck” right before kick drop**

---

## 🌀 Rhythmic Automation

- **Auto-Pan synced to tempo**
- **LFO to volume or pitch** (sync ¼ or ⅛)
- Use envelopes to pulse effects

---

## 🧠 Pro Ideas

- Automate **saturation or distortion drive** in chorus only
- Automate **width/spread** for big drop feel
- Use **dummy clips** with automation-only envelopes in Ableton

💡 *If your track feels static, automate something. Tiny movement = major emotion.*
