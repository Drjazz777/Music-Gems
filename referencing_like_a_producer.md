# Referencing Like a Producer

Don’t just copy a reference — **extract its emotional DNA.**

## 🔍 What to Listen For

### 1. Energy Curve
- Does the song get louder, wider, or more intense in the chorus?
- Is there a breakdown that strips away everything?
- Where’s the biggest moment — and how did they make it feel big?

### 2. Texture
- Is the mix dry or wet?
- Is it noisy, clean, analog, warm, cold?
- How much room is in the mix?

### 3. Focus
- What’s front and center? Is it always the vocal?
- Are the drums forward, or tucked behind instruments?

## 🧪 Translate, Don’t Imitate
- If the reference has **crunchy synths**, how can you get *your* synths to feel as dirty — using your tools?
- If the vocal feels *glued*, is it EQ? Compression? Reverb? Doubling?

## 🧠 Reference Thinking
> “How does this track feel?”  
> “What did they *do* to make me feel that?”

Reverse engineer their choices — then make your own.
