## 🎯 What Is a Glue Bus?

A “glue bus” is a group channel (usually for drums, instruments, or the full mix) with **compression and tone processing** applied to “glue” the elements together — making them feel like they were recorded in the same space.

## 🧰 When to Use One

- **Drum bus** (kick, snare, perc)
- **Instrument bus** (synths, keys, guitars)
- **Backing vocal bus**
- **Pre-master mix bus** (NOT post-limiter)

## 🔧 Compression Settings

Use a **Glue Compressor** or standard VCA-style comp:

| Parameter  | Suggested Setting             |
|------------|-------------------------------|
| Ratio      | 2:1 to 4:1                    |
| Attack     | Slow (10–30ms)                |
| Release    | Auto or fast (100–300ms)      |
| Threshold  | Just 1–3dB gain reduction     |

🎯 *You’re not squashing — you’re bonding.*

## 🌶️ Saturation Strategies

- Subtle **drive** after compression adds harmonic flavor
- Use **Softube Saturation Knob**, **Ableton Saturator**, or **CHOW Tape**
- Keep it at “barely audible” levels — enough to add warmth

---

## 📌 Bus EQ Tips

- **High-pass gently** to remove rumble (30–50 Hz)
- **Tilt EQ** or high-shelf boost for sparkle on instrument bus
- Use **mid dip (200–400 Hz)** to avoid mud stacking

🧠 *The glue bus is like the final coat of finish on a wood table — subtle, but it pulls everything together.*
