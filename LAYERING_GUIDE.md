# üéõÔ∏è Audio Mastermind Layering & Sound Design Checklist

> This guide helps you layer instruments, drums, synths, and samples for maximum clarity, vibe, and genre flexibility ‚Äî from ambient synth scores to hard-hitting Timbaland grooves.

---

## üîä DRUM LAYERING

- [ ] Layer kick with sub (trap/Dean) or click (pop)
- [ ] Stack 2‚Äì3 snares/claps (different textures: analog, acoustic, FM)
- [ ] Use hi-hats with contrast: tight + loose, clean + dusty
- [ ] Add percussion loops or found sounds (recordings, foley, clicks)

**Tips:**
- High-pass all non-sub kicks to avoid mud
- Timbaland often layers dry + wet claps + room FX
- Mike Dean favors synthetic + tuned percussion textures

---

## üéπ SYNTH & INSTRUMENT LAYERING

- [ ] Choose 2‚Äì3 layers for chords:
  - [ ] Pad (e.g., string machine, analog)
  - [ ] Pluck (e.g., Juno, piano, M1)
  - [ ] Body (e.g., midrange synth or FM tone)
- [ ] Lead synths: 1 main + 1 ‚Äútexture‚Äù (reverb tail, detune, white noise layer)
- [ ] Bass: one clean low + one harmonically rich (Saturator, Waveshaper)

**Layering Styles:**
- **Mike Dean**: detuned synths, pads with slow attack, minor key
- **Timbaland**: tuned percussive synths, short stabs with rhythmic purpose
- **Pop/Disco**: sustained chords, wide stereo pads, funky plucks

---

## üéõÔ∏è EFFECTS LAYERING

- [ ] Send all layers to a reverb bus (Raum, Valhalla, etc.)
- [ ] Use chorus (TAL-Chorus, Ableton Ensemble) for retro pads
- [ ] Add light tape wow/flutter to one layer for movement
- [ ] Pan layers wide but not identically ‚Äî balance with care

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è FREQUENCY & DYNAMICS CONTROL

- [ ] Use EQ to carve layers (cut where others peak)
- [ ] Compress busses lightly to glue stacks
- [ ] Use stereo imager or Utility for width control
- [ ] Low-pass non-leads for clarity

**Free Tools:**
- EQ Eight, Glue Compressor
- CHOW Tape, Softube Saturation Knob
- Ozone Imager 2 (free)

---

## üß† CREATIVE LAYERING TRICKS

- [ ] Add reversed layer with reverb tail (lead or pad)
- [ ] Double one synth with piano or guitar layer
- [ ] Copy melody to noise or bell layer (low volume for sparkle)
- [ ] Shift pitch of duplicate layer ¬±7 semitones (for lush width)

---

## Export Checklist

- [ ] Bounce each stem group (Drums, Bass, Synths, FX)
- [ ] Export dry + wet versions
- [ ] Save layered presets (e.g., Instrument Rack or Kontakt Multi)
