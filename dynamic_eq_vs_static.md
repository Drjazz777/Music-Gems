# ⚖️ Dynamic EQ vs. Static EQ

> When to cut permanently, and when to let the mix decide.

---

## 🧠 What’s the Difference?

- **Static EQ**: A fixed gain adjustment at a frequency (e.g., cutting 2 kHz by -3 dB no matter what).
- **Dynamic EQ**: Reacts only when that frequency becomes loud enough — like a frequency-specific compressor.

## 🛠️ When to Use Each

| Scenario                           | Use Static EQ? | Use Dynamic EQ? |
|------------------------------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Removing low-end rumble            | ✅ Yes          | ❌              |
| Vocal clashing with synth pads     | ❌              | ✅ Yes          |
| Kick + bass masking                | ✅ Initial cut  | ✅ Refined duck |
| De-essing harsh vocals             | ❌              | ✅ Best option  |
| Taming resonance in a reverb tail  | ❌              | ✅ Very clean   |

## 🧠 Power Tip

Dynamic EQ is best when:
- The conflict isn’t *always* present
- You want to **preserve tone**, not just cut
- You’re layering dense instruments and want one to move slightly

💡 *Static EQ is carving. Dynamic EQ is conversation.*
