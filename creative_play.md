### 💡 Trick 1: Reverse Automation
- Reverse your automation lanes instead of your audio.
- Try this on reverb tails, LFO rates, or filter sweeps.
- It creates a feeling of “emotional rewind.”

---

### 💡 Trick 2: Sidechain to Weird Things
- Sidechain synth pads to your **hi-hats** for unexpected rhythmic breath.
- Sidechain distortion to a melodic vocal track for subtle, ghostly pulses.

---

### 💡 Trick 3: Delay as a Percussion Layer
- Ping-pong delay + short decay + high feedback = pseudo-percussion.
- Use on rimshots, vocal phrases, or melodic percussion.

### 💡 Trick 4: Genre Smash
| Source Genre | Target Genre | How |
|--------------|--------------|-----|
| Trap Drums   | Bossa Nova   | Slow tempo, 3/4 swing, rim clicks |
| Techno Synths| Funk Guitar  | Modulate pitch with envelopes |
| Disco Pads   | Dark R&B     | Refilter, saturate, detune slightly |
