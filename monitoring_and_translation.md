- Headphones
- Car speakers
- Earbuds
- TV / phone / laptop speakers

## âœ… Best Practices

- âœ… **Mix at low volume** (youâ€™ll catch harshness and balance problems)
- âœ… Use a **mono switch** (Utility plugin or check mono mix bus)
- âœ… Use a **spectrum analyzer** (SPAN, Abletonâ€™s Spectrum)
- âœ… Listen on multiple speakers *before* mastering

2. Headphones (studio + casual)
