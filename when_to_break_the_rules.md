# When to Break the Rules

Rules exist to get you to a professional baseline — but *vibe* lives in the exceptions.

## Common Rules Worth Breaking (When It Sounds Better)

### 1. "Keep your mix clean."
**Break it if:** The noise floor *adds vibe.* Lo-fi, cassette-style tracks *need* a bit of hiss or hum. It gives glue.

### 2. "Don’t clip your master."
**Break it if:** You’re using it creatively. Artists like JPEGMAFIA or Justice *slam* their master on purpose to get aggression. Clip with intention, then tame afterward.

### 3. "Bass should always be mono."
**Break it if:** You want movement in upper bass layers. Try chorus or stereo widening on a *midrange bass* (above ~150 Hz), while keeping sub clean.

### 4. "Always compress vocals."
**Break it if:** The singer has natural control and the genre calls for intimacy. Some indie/folk tracks sound *better* uncompressed — raw and human.

### 5. "Always reference pro mixes."
**Break it if:** You're intentionally *creating* something new. References guide balance — but never let them override originality.

Always ask: “Does it sound cooler?” If yes, that’s your new rule.
