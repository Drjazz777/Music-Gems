# 🎛️ Justice / The Weeknd Style Reese Bass Sound Design (Serum)

> Wide, detuned, gritty, cinematic. This Reese isn’t for DnB — it’s for synth-pop, French house, and noir pop.

---

## 🧱 Core Reese Concepts

- Detuned saws = phasing movement
- Low-pass filters + drive = weight + warmth
- Modulation = evolving motion
- Saturation = harmonics
- Stereo awareness = phase-safe width

---

## 🔧 Serum Reese Setup

### Oscillators

- **OSC A**: Saw wave (Analog > Basic Shapes or JP-Saw)
- **OSC B**: Same wave, detuned slightly
  - Detune: ~10–15 cents
  - Optional: use different wavetable for subtle movement

### Filter

- **MG Low 12** or **MG Low 24**
- Cutoff: 100–200 Hz
- Drive: 40–80% for analog-like warmth
- Reso: Low (~10–20%)

---

## 🌀 Modulation (Adds Life)

### LFO 1 → Filter Cutoff
- Shape: triangle or smooth saw
- Rate: 1/4 note or slower (depending on tempo)
- Depth: 5–10%
- Creates evolving filter movement

### LFO 2 (optional) → Oscillator A/B fine pitch
- Tiny movement = more motion
- Rate: slow (1–4 bars), Depth: very subtle

## 🧪 FX Chain (Serum FX Tab)

| FX             | Settings                                                |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Distortion** | Tube / Soft Clip, Drive ~40–70%, Mix 100%               |
| **Chorus**     | Rate: ~0.1 Hz, Mix: 40–60% for stereo spread            |
| **Compressor** | Multiband ON, gentle squashing for clarity              |
| **EQ**         | High-shelf cut 7–10 kHz if fizz develops from distortion|

## 🎧 Performance Tips

- Enable **Mono** and **Legato** mode for basslines
- Add **Portamento Glide** (0.1–0.3 sec) for note transitions
- Play lower notes with slow filter for cinematic feel

---

## 🧠 Bonus: Layer with a clean sub
- Add Sub Oscillator (pure sine)
- Keep sub mono + filtered below 80 Hz
- Optional: parallel saturate upper layer only
