# 🎹 Mike Dean-Style Synth Stacks

> Wide, ominous, analog synth walls that feel like smoke and sunset

---

## 🔧 Sound Design Traits

- Analog texture (Juno, OB-6, Moog-like)
- Slow attack, long release
- Detuned, chorus-rich
- Heavy use of drive/saturation
- Filter motion (envelopes + LFOs)

## 🔁 Synth Stack Recipe (3 Layers)

| Layer       | Source            | Notes                                      |
|-------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Base Pad    | Juno or OB-style  | Wide, mid-heavy, chorus on                 |
| Mid Stack   | Saw + Pulse       | Slightly detuned, filter modulated         |
| Top Air     | Sine or formant   | High-passed, reverb-drenched for space     |

## 🧰 Effects Chain

1. **Saturation or Tape** — Add analog glue
2. **Chorus** — Use TAL-Chorus-LX or Juno emulation
3. **Stereo Imaging** — Slight offset/panning between layers
4. **Reverb (Hall)** — Long tail, low mix (10–20%)
5. **Filter Movement** — Automate LPF or notch to evolve over time

## 🧠 Harmony Trick

Use **sus2, sus4, and minor 7th chords** — gives that moody Dean tension  
Try Dmin7 → Gsus4 → Fmaj7 over a slow beat

🌀 *Dean's stacks aren't just synths — they're weather systems.*
