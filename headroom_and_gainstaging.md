# 📏 Headroom & Gain Staging

> The art of keeping your mix clean, balanced, and ready for mastering.

## 🧠 What Is Headroom?

**Headroom** is the space between your loudest peak and digital distortion (0 dBFS). More headroom = more mix clarity.

---

## 📊 Recommended Targets

- **Individual tracks**: Peak around -6 to -12 dB
- **Buses (drums, synths, vocals)**: Peak -6 dB or lower
- **Master channel (pre-limiter)**: Peak -6 dB, LUFS around -18 to -14

---

## 🧰 How to Gain Stage

1. Set input levels during recording (peaks at -6 to -12 dB)
2. Use Utility/Gain plugin to adjust track level, NOT faders
3. Group tracks and balance groups
4. Avoid red on meters anywhere

---

## 🎚️ Clip Gain vs Fader

- Use **clip gain** or Utility plugin to set raw volume
- Use **fader** for musical balance in the mix
- **Don’t mix with just the faders!** Get gain right first

💡 *Clean gain = clean plugins = clean mix. If your compressor is fighting your level, your gain staging is off.*
