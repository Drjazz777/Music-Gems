> A collection of real-world synth layer combinations designed for width, warmth, sparkle, and vibe. These patches can be used as starting points and tweaked to suit any genre.

## 🧪 1. Serum + Juno Pad Stack (Synth-Pop / R&B)

**Goal:** Warm mid pad + sparkly top pad = one lush, vintage-modern superpad

- **Layer 1: Juno (e.g. TAL-U-No-LX)**
  - Patch: Slow analog pad with chorus
  - EQ: HPF @ 60 Hz, LPF @ 8 kHz
- **Layer 2: Serum**
  - Patch: Airy wavetable pad or shimmer with mod LFO
  - EQ: HPF @ 250 Hz, boost 9 kHz
- **Group FX:**
  - Glue Compressor (slow attack)
  - Shared Chorus & Raum reverb
  - Optional: CHOW Tape Model for lo-fi warmth

## 🎸 2. Pluck + Pad Hybrid (Pop, House, Trap)

**Goal:** Add rhythmic definition to soft chords

- **Layer 1: Pluck Synth (e.g. DX7, Operator)**
  - Fast attack, short decay
  - Delay + slight chorus
- **Layer 2: Warm Pad (Analog Lab or Nabla)**
  - Long release, slow attack
  - Sidechain both to kick (if house/trap)

## 🔥 3. SuperSaw + FM Growl (EDM, Synthwave)

**Goal:** Massive stereo width + aggressive body

- **Layer 1: SuperSaw (Serum or Vital)**
  - Wide unison spread, slightly detuned
- **Layer 2: FM Bass or Reese-style synth**
  - Mono, mid-focused, phase distortion
- **Group FX:**
  - Saturation
  - OTT multiband compression
  - Reverb (wide but high-passed)

## 💫 4. Bell + Voice Pad (Alt-Pop / Ambient)

**Goal:** Ethereal texture with bite and personality

- **Layer 1: Bell Tone (e.g. Mallets in LABS)**
  - Reverb-heavy, high-shelf boosted
- **Layer 2: Vocal Pad or Choir (Kontakt / LABS)**
  - Gently panned for width
- **FX:**
  - Reverb on separate bus
  - Optional delay sync’d to tempo

## 🎛️ Workflow Tip

Save all synth layer groups as **Instrument Racks** in Ableton so you can easily recall them with FX and macro mappings intact.
