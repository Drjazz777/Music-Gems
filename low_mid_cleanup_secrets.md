# Low-Mid Cleanup Secrets

## The Problem:
Everything sounds good solo. But together? MUD CITY. The low-mids (150–500 Hz) are the usual suspect.

---

## 1. Use **Subtractive EQ** on Busy Groups
- On synth busses, string stacks, or pads — use a **broad cut** around 250–400 Hz.
- Use a spectrum analyzer to find energy build-ups.

---

## 2. **High-Pass Instruments That Don’t Need Low-Mids**
- Guitars? Try 100–150 Hz.
- Pads? Try 200 Hz.
- FX? 300 Hz and up.
Don’t let non-bass elements pile up in the basement.

---

## 3. Be Gentle with Vocals
- Instead of cutting mids, **boost 1–3 kHz** to add clarity and let the vocals shine *above* the low-mid clutter.

---

## 4. Use Dynamic EQ for Moving Parts
- When a synth or pad only gets muddy in the chorus? Use dynamic EQ or multiband compression to cut **only when needed**.

---

## 5. Compare in Mono
- A good mix survives mono. If the low-mids collapse or get bloated, go back and clean with subtle cuts on groups.

---

## Go-To Frequencies:
- **Boxy = 200–300 Hz**
- **Muddy = 250–500 Hz**
- **Cloudy = overlapping pads + bass in 150–250 Hz**

A clear low-mid range = space to breathe, punch to hit, and warmth that doesn’t overwhelm.
