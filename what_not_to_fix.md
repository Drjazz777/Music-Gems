# What NOT to Fix

Some problems are actually *charm*.

---

## 🌫️ Imperfect is Perfect
- **Mic bleed** on vocals? Might add realism.
- **Background noise** in a lo-fi piano? Adds depth and vibe.
- **Pitchy vocal note** that *hurts but hurts good?* KEEP IT.

---

## 🤖 Don’t Over-Correct
- Don’t auto-tune every word.
- Don’t quantize everything to the grid.
- Don’t remove every frequency bump in a sweep — some resonances are part of the character.

---

## 🎸 Leave Grit
- Don’t over-EQ a warm synth or guitar — the low-mid build-up *is* the warmth.
- Don’t squash transients out of live drums — leave some snap and chaos.

## 👂 Ask This:
> “If I ‘fix’ this… do I lose what makes it interesting?”

Sometimes it’s not broken. It’s just *vibing.*
