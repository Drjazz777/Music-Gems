# 🎨 Creative FX Chains (For Producers Who Don’t Play Safe)

> Weird, wonderful FX stacks that turn bland sounds into signature tones.

## 🎛️ Chain Ideas

### 1. Chorus > Reverb > Low-Pass > Delay

- Pads, leads, backing vocals
- Makes things sound dreamy & retro
- Add automation to LPF cutoff for movement

### 2. Tape → Flanger → OTT → Bitcrush

- Bass, drum bus
- VHS + grit + punch combo
- Blend in parallel

### 3. Amp Sim > Auto-Pan > Wide Reverb

- Guitars or vocal doubles
- Great for left/right FX movement
- Auto-pan on quarter notes creates swirl

### 4. Vocal FX Rack (Instant Weird Mode)

- Pitch Shifter → Granular Delay → Reverb → Utility (Width 130%)
- Use on ad-libs, whispers, or ambient ear candy

## 🔥 Bonus: “Disco Air” Bus

- Instruments Bus → High-pass at 5kHz → Reverb + Phaser → Sidechain to Kick
- Adds sparkle and rhythmic motion above the mix
