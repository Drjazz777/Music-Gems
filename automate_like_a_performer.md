# Automate Like a Performer

Automation isn’t just for transitions — it’s how you make your mix *breathe*.

---

## 🎤 Vocal Automation Moves
- **Volume rides** → Keep vocals even without crushing them.
- **Delay throws** → Send specific words to a delay return for ear candy.
- **Reverb throws** → Increase send *after* big lines to let them ring out.

---

## 🎚️ Instrument Tricks
- **Low-pass filters** → slowly close in breakdowns, open during drops.
- **Panning drift** → automate slight L/R shifts on pads or FX.
- **Drive increases** → automate saturation during a build for more tension.

## 🕺 FX and Energy Building
- Automate **reverb decay time** to grow during a build-up.
- Use a high-pass filter that *sweeps up* to create tension, then drops away.
- Automate the *width* of stereo tools (Utility in Ableton) — narrow verse, wide chorus.

## 🧠 Think Like a Performer
Ask:
- “Would a singer lean into this word?”
- “Would a guitarist dig in here?”
- “Would the drummer go full pocket?”

Automation = invisible performance.
