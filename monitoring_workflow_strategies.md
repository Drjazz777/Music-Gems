# Monitoring Workflow Strategies

Your monitoring setup is your most valuable mixing tool. If your mix doesn't translate, it's not your ears ‚Äî it's your workflow.

## üéß Monitoring Types

| Monitor Type | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|--------------|-----------|------------|
| Studio Monitors | Detail, space, clarity | Room dependent |
| Headphones | Imaging, frequency checks | Low-end deception |
| Consumer Devices (AirPods, phone) | Real-world translation | Lack of detail |
| Car System | Midrange & sub clarity | Inconsistent environments |

## üîÅ Reference Workflow (Recommended)

1. **Mix on Studio Monitors at 75‚Äì80 dB SPL**
   - Calibrate if possible using pink noise.
   - Lower volume occasionally to test balance.

2. **Cross-Reference in Mono (Utility Plugin)**
   - Drop a Utility in mono on the master every 10‚Äì15 minutes.
   - Listen for:
     - Disappearing vocals
     - Hollow or unglued midrange
     - Reverb tails vanishing

3. **Check with Headphones**
   - Listen for:
     - Panning balance
     - Sub frequencies (fake vs real)
     - Delay tail clarity

4. **Final Checks on AirPods, Laptop & Phone**
   - Bounce a -6 dB test mix.
   - Check for:
     - Kick/bass clarity on tiny speakers
     - Vocal intelligibility
     - Overall vibe

## üéØ Target Levels

| Source | Volume Target | Tip |
|--------|----------------|-----|
| Studio Monitors | ~78 dB SPL (C-weighted) | Use pink noise to calibrate |
| Headphones | Moderate volume | Don‚Äôt mix loud; fatigue is real |
| AirPods/Phone | Normal listening level | Use as a vibe test, not detail |

## üõ†Ô∏è Room Correction Tips

- Use Sonarworks or Arc to flatten your monitor response.
- Treat first reflections (behind monitors, side walls).
- Avoid mixing too close to walls or windows ‚Äî they lie to your low end.
