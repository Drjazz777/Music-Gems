# 🔊 Audio Mastermind – Bass Mixing Strategies

> A comprehensive, genre-flexible approach to bass mixing — from subtle low-end glue to subby monsters. Works across synth-pop, trap, disco, cinematic, house, funk, and more.

---

## 🎯 Goals of Bass Mixing

- Make bass **present but controlled**
- Let bass and kick **work together**, not fight
- Translate bass across **all systems** (phones, earbuds, club speakers)
- Add **character and tone** through saturation
- Create **movement and punch** with compression and automation

## 🔀 BASS TYPES (Know What You're Mixing)

| Type               | Description                                   | Primary Frequencies |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| **Sub Bass**       | Pure sine/triangle wave, no overtones         | 30–80 Hz            |
| **Synth Bass**     | Juno, Moog, Serum-type pads/leads             | 80–300 Hz           |
| **808 Bass**       | Trap-style long, tuned kicks or sine drops    | 30–100 Hz + mid spike |
| **Electric Bass**  | Recorded DI or amp                             | 60–500 Hz, peaks at 100–300 Hz |
| **Bass Guitar Loops** | Sample-based grooves                       | Full range, may need sculpting |

## 🛠️ STEP 1: EQ – Clean, Carve, and Control

### ✅ General EQ Moves:

- **High-pass Filter (HPF)**: Always clean below 20–30 Hz to remove rumble
- **Cut Mud**: Dip 150–300 Hz if it clouds the mix
- **Add Presence**: Boost 700 Hz – 2 kHz (for plucky/funky/growly tones)
- **Sub Boom Control**: Notch 50–90 Hz **only if bass is overpowering kick**
- **Shelving**: Gently lift or suppress lows for overall balance

---

## 🧠 Frequency Pairing: Kick vs Bass

- **Kick + Sub Bass**:
  - Use **sidechain compression** OR dynamic EQ to let kick punch
  - Tune kick and bass to **different notes** or slightly offset octaves
- **Kick + Mid Bass**:
  - Kick in **50–90 Hz**, bass in **100–200 Hz**
  - Use **saturation** to give bass presence, not just boom

---

## 🧰 STEP 2: Compression – Control Movement

### ✅ Tame Peaks
- Use standard compressor (Ableton’s Compressor or Glue Compressor)
  - **Ratio**: 3:1 or 4:1
  - **Attack**: 5–10 ms
  - **Release**: Auto or 100 ms
  - **Threshold**: Just enough to reduce 2–4 dB

### ✅ Sidechain to Kick
- Set up sidechain compression to **duck bass when kick hits**
- Start with:
  - **Fast attack**
  - **Release time synced to kick rhythm (100–300 ms)**

### ✅ Multiband Compression (Optional)
- Target ONLY sub-band to control low-end pumping
- Great for live bass, 808s, or wide dynamic parts

---

## 🔥 STEP 3: Saturation – Add Harmonics

| Tool                  | Use Case                        |
|------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Ableton Saturator**  | Subtle warmth or color         |
| **CHOW Tape**          | Tape-style compression + smear |
| **Softube Sat Knob**   | Add drive or analog thickness  |
| **RC-20 / Vinyl FX**   | Lo-fi bass for lofi/alt-pop    |

### ✅ Use on:
- **Mid/High Bass Layer** ONLY — not the pure sub
- Target saturation to around **100–600 Hz** for body

---

## 🌀 STEP 4: Stereo, Width & Mono

- **Keep sub (under 120 Hz) in mono**
  - Use EQ to filter sides below 120 Hz
- Use **Utility** plugin to check mono compatibility
- For mid/high bass:
  - Use **chorus or width tools** to widen — but only above ~300 Hz

---

## 🧱 STEP 5: Layering Techniques

| Layer        | Purpose                            |
|--------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Sub Bass** | Body and weight                     |
| **Mid Bass** | Character, definition, stereo feel |
| **Attack Layer** | Click or pluck for punch         |
| **Distortion Layer** | Extra grit/edge (optional)  |

Always **EQ each layer** to stay in its lane:
- **Low-pass** the sub
- **High-pass** the mids
- Use **group processing** for shared glue

---

## 🎛️ STEP 6: Automation & Movement

- Automate **bass volume or filter cutoff** to control energy between sections
- Use **saturation automation** to add energy in chorus/drop
- Try **sidechain shape plugins** (e.g., ShaperBox, Duck) for modern EDM/Pop ducking

---

## 📐 STEP 7: Monitoring & Translation

- Always test bass:
  - On small speakers
  - In mono (Utility plugin)
  - At low volume (still audible? Too loud?)
- Use **spectrum analyzer** (e.g., SPAN, Ableton’s Spectrum) to compare vs reference

## 🧠 Quick Fixes by Problem

| Problem                      | Try This                                               |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Bass too boomy              | HPF at 30 Hz, dip 60–80 Hz, compress with fast release |
| Bass disappears in chorus   | Add saturation, boost ~150 Hz, automate level up       |
| Bass fighting synths        | Duck synth lows, EQ carve mids                         |
| Bass sounds thin on phone   | Add harmonics 700–1kHz, saturate midrange              |
| Bass lacks groove           | Add sidechain or envelope shaping                      |

## ✅ Recap Workflow

1. 🎛️ **Identify the bass role**: sub? growl? funk?
2. 🧽 **EQ cleanup**: HPF + cut mud + boost character
3. 🧰 **Compression**: tame peaks, add glue, sidechain to kick
4. 🔥 **Saturation**: give it tone and phone-friendly presence
5. 🎚️ **Stereo control**: mono sub, wide mids (carefully)
6. 🎨 **Layer intentionally**: sub, mid, grit, or punch layers
7. 🎧 **Test on every system**: earbuds, monitors, mono, loud, quiet
