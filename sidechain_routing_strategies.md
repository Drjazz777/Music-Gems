## 🎯 Creative Sidechain Ideas

| Source           | Target             | Why It’s Cool                             |
|------------------|--------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Kick             | Bass               | Traditional ducking for punch             |
| Snare            | Reverb or Delay    | Keeps space clear when snare hits         |
| Vocal            | Synth Pad          | Pads fade back during vocal lines         |
| Perc Loop        | Background FX bus  | Rhythmically pulses reverb textures       |
| Ghost Trigger    | Anything           | Invisible sidechain using muted midi      |

## 🌀 Envelope Shaping Plugins

- **ShaperBox / LFO Tool**: design ducking curves
- **Volume automation lanes**: manual but powerful
- **Ableton’s Auto Pan trick**:
  - Set to 100%, square wave, inverted phase = fake sidechain

## ⚠️ Tips

- Use EQ sidechain filters to only trigger from sub or mids
- Don’t over-duck — preserve musicality
- Automate threshold or amount for dynamic scenes

💡 *Sidechaining isn’t just about loudness — it’s about space and groove.*
