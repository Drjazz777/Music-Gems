## üß† Key Modulation Targets

| What to Modulate       | Why                                     |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Filter Cutoff           | Movement and tone variation              |
| Pitch (fine)            | Analog-style instability                 |
| Volume                  | Swell, groove sync                       |
| Wavetable Position      | Evolving digital textures                |
| Distortion Amount       | Dynamic character and aggression         |
| Pan or Width            | Emotional motion in stereo               |

## üìê Strategies

### 1. Slow LFO to Filter
- LFO Shape: Triangle or sine
- Rate: 1‚Äì4 bars (or tempo-synced)
- Use subtle depth
- Great for Reese, moody pads, dubstep subs

### 2. Envelope Mod to Distortion
- Create a snappy, reactive distortion tail
- Short attack, quick decay
- Adds "pluck" to notes without EQ tricks

### 3. Macro-Controlled Width
- Assign width or chorus mix to macro
- Automate it across drop/chorus
- Make bass "breathe" into wide/full mix

## üí• Pro Application

- Modulate different parameters across **song sections**:
  - Add midrange saturation in chorus only
  - Remove LFO motion in breakdown
  - Add filter motion in bridge
