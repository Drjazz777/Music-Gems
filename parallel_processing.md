Parallel processing is the secret weapon of modern mixing — letting you combine the punch and clarity of unprocessed tracks with the warmth, excitement, or grit of processed duplicates.

## 🔁 What Is Parallel Processing?

It means applying effects to a *copy* of the signal, then blending it back in with the original. This preserves transients and dynamics while enhancing tone.

## 🧰 Common Types of Parallel Processing

### ✅ Parallel Compression (aka "NY Compression")

**Used for:** Drums, vocals, guitars, full mix bus  
**How to do it:**
1. Duplicate your track, or use a send/return bus.
2. Heavily compress the duplicate (e.g. 10:1 ratio, 10+ dB GR).
3. Blend it back in under the original.

🎚 Pro Tip: On vocals, blend it in just enough to add body and power.

### ✅ Parallel Saturation

**Used for:** Bass, vocals, synths  
**How to do it:**
1. Send your signal to a return track with saturation (tube, tape, lo-fi).
2. Blend to taste — usually around 10–30%.

🎛 Try this: Add a gentle **high-pass filter** before saturation to avoid muddying the low-end.

### ✅ Parallel EQ (Additive)

**Used for:** Bringing out air, sparkle, presence without harshness  
**How to do it:**
1. Duplicate the track.
2. Boost high-end or midrange frequencies aggressively (e.g. 8kHz shelf, 3kHz bell).
3. Blend it quietly under the main track.

🎯 Why? You can add presence without touching your clean original.

## 🎛 Tips for Managing Parallel Chains

- **Use phase-aligned plugins** or delay compensation to avoid smearing.
- **Name your return tracks clearly!** e.g. "Vocals Parallel Comp"
- Use **faders**, not plugin mix knobs, to control blend levels.
- Keep **parallel bus FX** *post-fader* unless you want pre-fader tricks.

## 🚀 Advanced Parallel Tricks

- **Parallel Sidechaining:** Compress a parallel chain *harder* than the main one, but only when the kick hits.
- **Parallel Delay/Verb:** Create a parallel FX bus *just for micro-delay or room verb* to add depth without mud.
- **Multiband Parallel Distortion:** Distort just the midrange in parallel and blend it for “presence glue.”
