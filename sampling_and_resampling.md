# 🎛️ Sampling & Resampling

> Creative ways to manipulate audio, improve CPU, and spark new ideas.

## 🧠 What Is Resampling?

**Resampling** means recording audio from another track or source **within your DAW**. It allows you to:
- Freeze creative choices
- Manipulate audio like clay
- Transform synths into samples

---

## 🔁 When to Resample

- CPU heavy synths with stacked FX
- Want to reverse/stretch/warp a sound
- Combine multiple layers into one sample
- Create glitch FX from processed clips
- Sample yourself for remixing

---

## 🎙️ Sampling Workflow

1. Create a new **audio track**
2. Set input to **"Resample"**
3. Arm and record any sound playing in Ableton

🎧 This captures FX, automation, and all sends — like recording from the master channel (but cleaner!).

## 💡 Creative Resample Ideas

| Source            | Use It To…                            |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Reverb tail       | Reverse, stretch, pitch up             |
| Chord stack       | Slice into pads or vocal-like tones    |
| Drum fill         | Rearrange into glitch loop             |
| Vocal chop        | Warp timing, pitch, or rhythm          |
| Full mix section  | Tape stop, stutter, or filter sweep FX |

## 🧪 Sample-Based Production Tricks

- **Re-pitch loops** to create new harmonies
- **Warp complex synths** into lo-fi textures
- Use **Simpler or Sampler** to re-sequence sounds
- Add new **envelopes, filter shapes, and pitch curves**

💡 *Resampling isn’t a workaround. It’s a creative workflow for producers who like to break their own sounds.*
