# 🧨 Trap 808 Design

> Get punchy, tuned, hard-hitting 808s that sound great in any system.

---

## 🎯 Core Goals

- Stay in key
- Avoid mud
- Control boominess
- Deliver character through distortion

---

## 🔧 Step-by-Step Design

### 1. Choose the Right Sample or Oscillator

- Use a clean sine or triangle wave
- Or pick a pre-saturated 808 sample

### 2. Pitch It to the Key of Your Track

- Always tune your 808 to **match your song key**
- Use Ableton's Tuner or Spectrum analyzer to confirm

---

## 📐 Processing Chain

### A. EQ: Clean the Mud

- Low-pass above 150 Hz if using extra grit layers
- Optional: notch around 200–300 Hz if boxy

### B. Saturation / Distortion

- Use **Softube Saturation Knob** or **Ableton Saturator**
- Push drive, then back off output to match volume
- Add parallel distortion for high-end punch

### C. Compression (Optional)

- Gentle compression can tame spikes
- Use sidechain from the kick for tight glue

---

## 🎹 Bonus: Glide & Slide

- Use **Mono + Legato + Glide (0.1–0.3 sec)** in your sampler/synth
- Automate pitch for trap slides
- Great for transitions, fills, and emotional moments

---

## 🧠 Pro Tip:

Use a second track with high-passed saturation **only for character.** Blend this in with your sub for speaker-safe 808s that still cut through.
