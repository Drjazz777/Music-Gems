> Your go-to vocal workflow for clean, modern, and expressive vocal mixes across genres.

## 🧹 1. Pre-Processing

- Remove background noise (if needed)
- Cut dead space between phrases
- Pitch correction (Waves Tune, Auto-Tune, or stock pitch tools)
- Comp multiple takes into one clean lead

## 🎚️ 2. Standard Vocal Chain

### 🔹 Step-by-Step:

1. **EQ (Subtractive)**  
   - HPF at 80–120 Hz (remove rumble)  
   - Cut boxy mids (200–500 Hz)  
   - De-ess area (4–8 kHz, subtle dip)

2. **Compression**  
   - 3:1 ratio, fast attack, medium release  
   - Aim for 3–6 dB gain reduction

3. **De-Esser**  
   - Narrow band at sibilant range (5–8kHz)  
   - Tame harsh “S” and “T” sounds

4. **EQ (Additive / Sweetening)**  
   - Air boost around 10–14 kHz  
   - Optional low-mid lift for body (~200 Hz)

---

## 🔊 3. Effects (Time-Based)

- **Delay**  
  - Ping pong or slapback  
  - Tempo-synced (¼ or ⅛ note)

- **Reverb**  
  - Plate for pop  
  - Hall for cinematic  
  - Short decay (~1–2s) for clarity

**Pro tip:** Use reverb/delay on return tracks for better control.

## 🎛️ 4. Advanced Additions

- **Parallel compression** for “in your face” vocals
- **Saturation** for warmth or edge
- **Doubles / Harmonies** for width

---

## 🎙️ Vocal Recording Tips

- Use a pop filter
- Record 6–12 inches from mic
- Monitor levels: -12 to -6 dB peak
- Record in a treated room or DIY booth

💡 *Treat vocals like a lead instrument — carve space, respect the tone, and support the performance.*
